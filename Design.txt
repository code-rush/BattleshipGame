##Design Decisions

- Added next_move, user_a, user_b, winner and game_over fields. I used game_over
  flag to mark completed games and other fields as KeyProperty to the Game.
- Added four fields to store board in Game(two for placing ships and two to play on).
  I used PickleProperty to store the board.

I could not think of a solution to change ships rotations. The ships designs 
are hardcoded and can only be placed as they are without any rotation. 
The ships placements cells are constant, hence I used them to check if a player 
has got 'O' for that number of counts. If yes, then he is announced a winner and
the game is set to end. I think that this game would be easier to design on the front-end
than the backend since most of it has to be hardcoded to tackle each ship placements 
accordingly. It seems to be working perfectly for now although with some limitations, 
but it was fun solving some problems.
