##Design Decisions

- Added next_move, user_a, user_b, winner and game_over fields. I used game_over
  flag to mark completed games and other fields as KeyProperty to the Game.
- Added four fields to store board in Game(two for placing ships and two to play on).
  I used PickleProperty to store the board.

I could not think of a solution to change ships rotations. The ships designs 
are hardcoded and can only be placed as they are without any rotation. Also checking if each ships
is revealed by opponents making it visible for the player to be able to see that the player 
has got the hit correctly. I think that this game would be easier to design on the front-end
than the backend since most of it has to be hardcoded. It seems to be working perfectly for 
now although with some limitations, but it was fun solving some problems.
